# secbin — Security Policy & Threat Model

secbin is a **zero-knowledge sharing service** for notes and files: content — including file
names, folder structure and MIME types — is encrypted and decrypted only on the client, and the
decryption secret never leaves the client in normal operation. This document is the
authoritative statement of what secbin does and does **not** protect. Read it alongside
[`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md).

secbin is maintained by KSEC - Erez Kalman and is based on
[binthere](https://github.com/nxfu/binthere) by nxfu. Protocol v2 replaced binthere's v1
cryptography (Argon2id, access proofs, file shares) and added built-in accounts.

Treat secbin as a **security-sensitive cryptographic application**, not a normal web app.

## 1. Security goals

1. **Confidentiality of content from the server/storage layer.** The Worker, KV, R2, the
   Durable Objects and Cloudflare store only ciphertext and non-secret settings. They cannot
   read note text, file contents, file or folder names, MIME types or per-file sizes: all of
   that is encrypted client-side; the key (`F`, the URL fragment) is never transmitted.
2. **Integrity.** AES-256-GCM authenticates ciphertext; the canonical AAD binds every
   security-relevant field (`SPEC.md` §4); file chunks bind their index and the chunk count, so
   reordering and truncation fail closed.
3. **Password gating independent of the URL secret.** Neither the fragment alone nor the
   password alone opens a password-protected share (`SPEC.md` §2). Passwords are stretched with
   memory-hard **Argon2id** (64 MiB).
4. **No view is ever spent on a wrong link or a wrong password.** The server verifies two
   access proofs (`SPEC.md` §2) before releasing ciphertext or decrementing a view. The public
   head carries no wrapped key, so a password cannot be attacked offline by someone who only
   holds the link; online guesses are rate-limited per IP (§6).
5. **Exact view limits** enforced atomically by Durable Objects.
6. **No key exfiltration through the app's own code** (§4): strict CSP, first-party assets only,
   DOM construction only, and a viewer that never executes content.
7. **Accounts that cannot be taken over from the network**: server-verified sessions,
   brute-force protection, single-use setup tokens (§6).

## 2. Explicit non-goals

- **Anonymity / metadata privacy** — see §3.
- **Protection against a compromised or malicious deployment** — see §4.
- **Protection of a secret you disclose.** Anyone with the full link (and the password, if set)
  can open the share up to its view limit. Links can persist in browser history and chat
  previews; this is inherent to fragment-key delivery.
- **Copy protection.** A view limit bounds how often ciphertext is released, not what a reader
  keeps.
- **Guaranteed deletion from all layers/backups.** KV deletes can take ~60 s to propagate.
- **Hiding account metadata from the operator.** Which account created which share, share
  labels, and the audit log are server-side and visible to the owner.
- **Protection against a malicious owner.** The owner can impersonate users and change limits;
  the owner still cannot decrypt shares.
- **DoS protection** beyond best-effort guards.

## 3. What the server can and cannot see

**Never visible to the server:** the fragment key `F`, passwords, the KEK/CEK/FK, note text,
file contents, **file and folder names, folder structure, MIME types, per-file sizes and
mtimes**, the viewer opt-in and its policy snapshot (all inside the encrypted manifest).

**Visible to the server (and Cloudflare), and possibly logged:**

- IP addresses, timestamps, User-Agent and access patterns.
- Share ids (they appear in request paths), storage class (note / view-limited / files).
- Ciphertext size: for notes an upper bound on the plaintext size; for file shares only the
  **padded total** (64 KiB granularity) and the chunk count — never individual file sizes.
- Expiry, view limit, remaining views, and lifecycle events.
- **Account metadata:** usernames, which account created which share id, share **labels**
  (plain text by design — the UI warns not to put secrets in them), quota counters, API-key
  names and use times, the activity/audit log.
- For accounts that have a *files-per-share* or *max-file-size* limit, the creating client
  declares the file count / largest file size at upload time so the server can check it. The
  values are not stored. They cannot be verified by the server (the stream is encrypted);
  only the total size is enforced exactly.
- Access-proof *hashes*, delete/upload/grant/API-key *hashes*, and password verifiers
  (`SHA-256("secbin-auth/v2" ‖ Argon2id(password))`).

Tokens (delete, upload, download grant) and proofs travel in request **headers**, never URLs,
so they do not land in logged request URLs.

## 4. Frontend threat model — "XSS = key exfiltration"

Any script on the page can read `location.hash` and the decrypted content, so XSS equals full
compromise. Defenses:

- **Strict CSP** on every page and asset (`public/_headers`, mirrored in `src/lib/http.js` for
  Worker-served dashboard pages):
  ```
  default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self';
  img-src 'self' data: blob:; media-src blob:; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self';
  worker-src 'self'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';
  frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none'
  ```
  - `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` allows **WebAssembly compilation only** (Argon2id; pdf.js image
    decoders). JavaScript `eval`/`new Function` remain blocked.
  - `blob:` for images/media is used only by the viewer for content it has sniffed itself.
  - `worker-src 'self'` is for pdf.js's parser worker.
- **First-party only.** No CDNs, analytics or third-party scripts. The two vendored libraries
  (hash-wasm, pdf.js) are pinned, SHA-256-verified and rebuilt reproducibly by
  `tools/vendor.mjs` (`public/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`).
- **DOM construction only.** Decrypted content, file names and server strings are rendered
  with `textContent`; the element helper refuses `innerHTML`, `on*`, `style` and `srcdoc`.
  Markdown is a raw-HTML-free subset with an `http`/`https`/`mailto` link allowlist.
- **Safe viewer** (optional, admin-governed, sender opt-in per share):
  - text/Markdown/code: inert DOM, size-capped;
  - images: the type comes from our own signature sniffing (never the sender's label); the
    dimensions are parsed from the header and oversized images (> 40 megapixels) are refused
    **before** decoding; **SVG is never rendered** (it is not in the allowed raster set);
  - PDF: vendored pdf.js core only — no scripting sandbox, no annotation/form layer, no XFA, no
    eval — rasterized page by page to a canvas with page and pixel caps; embedded PDF
    JavaScript never runs;
  - audio/video: native elements from sniffed `blob:` URLs, no autoplay;
  - one preview at a time; object URLs are revoked on close; global disable takes effect for
    existing links immediately (the page intersects the sender's snapshot with the live
    policy).
- **Downloads** are always `application/octet-stream` / `application/zip` with sanitized
  names; ZIP member names come from validated paths (no absolute or `../` entries).

### Deployment-compromise limitation (important)

The browser downloads and trusts JavaScript from the server. Whoever controls the deployment,
the repository or the Cloudflare account can serve code that reads keys and plaintext. Client-side
encryption protects data from the *storage* layer, not from a compromised *delivery* of the app.

### The CLI

`cli/` (`secbin`) implements the same protocol with the same vendored modules (drift-tested).
Its trust anchor is your local installation. It never follows symlinks when sending, confines
downloads to the output directory, refuses to write through symlinks or overwrite without
`--force`, and reads the API key from `SECBIN_API_KEY` or a file — never a flag value. Share URLs
passed as arguments are visible to other local processes; `secbin get -` reads one from stdin.

## 5. Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Trusted with content? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sender's / recipient's browser + served JS | **Yes** (unavoidable) | §4 |
| CLI process | **Yes** | §4 |
| Network | No | TLS; the fragment is never sent |
| Worker, KV, R2, Durable Objects | No | Ciphertext + metadata (§3) |
| Owner / admin | No (content) | Sees account metadata, can impersonate; cannot decrypt |
| Holder of the full link (+ password) | **Yes** | That is the capability being shared |

## 6. Accounts, sessions and brute-force protection

- **Setup/recovery**: `/dashboard/setup` requires the `AUTHN` secret (≥ 32 chars, constant-time
  compare). A token value works **once** (its hash is recorded); recovery requires a new value.
  With `AUTHN` unset, setup rejects every request with `404` and never errors. Every setup is
  audited; the admin panel warns while `AUTHN` is still set.
- **Passwords** never reach the server: the client sends `Argon2id(password, salt)`; the server
  stores `SHA-256("secbin-auth/v2" ‖ that)`. Prelogin returns a stable, secret-keyed fake salt
  for unknown usernames (no enumeration). Minimum length (12) is enforced client-side — the
  server cannot see the password. Trade-off: the stretched value is password-equivalent in
  transit (TLS-protected), as with any client-side stretching scheme.
- **Sessions**: `__Host-` cookie, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict, containing a JWS (HS256,
  `SIG`) inside a JWE (A256GCM, `ENC`). Strict parsing (exact headers, no `alg: none`, no
  algorithm confusion). Every request re-checks revocation, disabled state and the per-user
  session version (bumped by password change/reset/disable), plus admin-configured idle and
  absolute timeouts. Missing/invalid `SIG`/`ENC` ⇒ login is unavailable (`503`), public links
  keep working.
- **CSRF**: state-changing calls must be non-simple (JSON content type or `X-Secbin-Intent`), are
  refused when `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`, and cookies are SameSite=Strict. The API has no CORS.
- **API keys** (`sbk_…`, stored hashed) authenticate share creation only — never account or
  admin endpoints. The owner decides who may hold keys and how many; API limits and quotas can
  only narrow the account's limits. Revoking API permission disables existing keys at once.
- **Impersonation** ("log in as"): owner only, never nested, no admin access or key minting
  while impersonating; each action is logged with the real actor (the user's own activity view
  shows it as theirs).
- **Brute-force protection** (admin-configurable, per IP; IPv6 aggregated to /64 by default):
  - `login`, `setup`, and `invalid` — unknown/expired share ids, **wrong `#` keys, wrong share
    passwords**, bad download grants and bad delete/upload tokens;
  - rule: X failures within a window ⇒ block for a duration; the admin sees and manages blocks
    and tracking;
  - manual allow/block rules for IPv4/IPv6 addresses and CIDR ranges (allow wins; blocks deny
    the whole API and dashboard);
  - account lockout after X failed logins (owner exempt — recover via setup if needed).
  - Kill switches: `DISABLE_BFP=true` (everything, including IP rules) and
    `DISABLE_BFP_SETUP=true` (setup only).

### API surface hardening

- No CORS headers; JSON bodies are read under a streaming byte cap (4 MiB; 8 MiB + 16 B for
  file chunks, with the exact expected size enforced).
- Every value is re-validated server-side (formats, views, expiry, limits, quotas, settings).
- Reads that spend views need custom headers (non-simple): ambient GETs never consume anything.
